            An ant’s life is one of rigor and pain. Dude, the ant’s name, is the
            hottest ant there is. He gets out of most work because he is also a 
            stupendous persuader,which is a good trait to have. On this one occasion,
            however, Dude had to actually do something. He was asked to go out around 
            the spider’s den and bring back a fly’s wing. Naturally, he was chosen because everybody
            hated him by this point except for the young ladies, who had no say in the food
            gathering schedule. As he exited the entrance to the ant cave he became immediately
            frightened by all the action around him. From the birds to the worms he was
            by far the smallest creature that crawled on the earth. His size, in this case, 
            was his strength in this situation, since nothing saw him. He easily snuck past the
            lazy spiders and made his way to the fly's wing, which was his primary target. He 
            grabbed the wing and made the slow journey back to his home, that he had no clue how 
            the wing would fit into, but he kept going. Right as he was getting to the house he
            felt a tug on the wing, and the next thing you know he is gone with the wind.

            As the ant got carried away he remembered his training of How to Escape All Situations
            by father ant. First he let go of the fly’s wing and fell to the ground. Then he remembered
            that was the only thing that the book said to do. Now, however, he needed some food for his family
            of ants, but he had no clue where he was or how to get home, since he was so short. So he turned on
            his internal compass and followed it home. Now that he knew where home was he set off again to find
            food. Walking passed the spiders home, Dude found that one of the spiders had lost a leg. His new
            adventure began. As expected, he cautiously snuck into their home and grabbed the leg as stealthy
            as a ninja. Also in the process of his sneakiness he forgot to silence his phone, which sounded like
            an air horn in the quiet spiders home. All the spiders were up and Dude was on the run.

            Scared for his life, Dude ran as fast as his little legs could carry him, which wasn’t fast at all. 
            The spiders spotted him and ran after Dude, but luckly dude found a little crack in the ground where
            the spiders couldn’t reach him. Now, however, he had to wait until the spiders got bored or until 
            they found new food. Dude waited. TIme passed and it started to get dark, but the spiders stayed.
            A little while later they started to fall asleep right where they stood and blocked him in. Dude 
            was left with no choice but to explore his crack in the ground. Walking slowly and cautiously, 
            Dude found a tunnel that led to another tunnel, and soon enough he was lost, alone, and afraid.
            He kept walking, though, because he had no other choice, and after he had lost all hope he 
            started to hear noises. He got closer and closer, and eventually he came across an opening in
            the ground. He looked into the hole of light and found that he was looking down at a funeral.
            Then he realized that it was his funeral, but then suddenly he slipped and fell right into his
            own coffin. There were mummers, screams, and laughs, but then everyone was happy and welcomed
            him back with glee.
