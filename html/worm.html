            Sadly, the year is 1776 and and there is still no freedom for us Worms, 
            since we are too small to be heard, and no one cares what a worm thinks.
            I, week and not feeling well, currently live in boston, which is not
            a great place for a worm to be right now. When you vomit me I find 
            it unpleasant. Like When you have to go to the doctor. During my 
            life, I have been pecked out of my home several times, and I also 
            disapprove of that action. Trying to hide from your babies, I find
            it nearly impossible, since they somehow always find me. I am not free yet.

            I, the worm, do not like when you devour me, which is very disturbing, 
            and then vomit me, as well, a bird would do to a worm, I find it inhumane.
            When I slowly slide down the back of your throat, slimy and rough,
            I think surely I have a greater purpose than this, since my mom said 
            that someday I will do great things. During my life, I have felt 
            somewhat disliked, but this has put me over the edge, you do not care
            about me or my personal rights, and now I feel like the world hates me.
            Frequently, I find myself thinking that if I was higher up in the 
            food chain I would be kind and compassionate to all little bugs, but
            the birds I would get rid of, and teach all of them a lesson in not 
            to devour bugs. Trying to escape you, I find myself on the chase 
            of my life, and sadly, I never come out on top. I dislike birds.

            Resting in my home, I find that I am no longer safe, since you always
            peck me out. When I find you most annoying is when you peck me out
            while I am consuming dinner, which means I do not even get to finish
            eating. I also don’t like when you peck me out in front of my
            wife and kids, my wife always gives me a hard time about that. Why
            do you always peck me out of my home. Besides needing me for
            food, nasty and not that helpful for me, is there any other 
            reason you eat me, my kids always find it disturbing, they think
            I cannot protect them. Sadly, I am getting too old for 
            this kind of thing, and naturally I do not want to die this way,
            is there any way that you could stop eating me. I need to feel safe.

            I ,long and weak, dislike when you feed me to your baby's, 
            since no one really wants to get eaten. Dolefully, you
            never catch me at a great and glorious time, which is one
            of the worst parts of being low in the food chain, I never
            get to pick when it is a satisfying time for me.
            While you eat me, I wonder am I actually that nutritious,
            I don’t think I am, but on second thought, I think I am 
            extremely nutritious, but i still do not want you to eat me.
            Squirming my way through you, I always get squashed.
            Before I go into you I am always a dull pink color, and
            when I come I am always white, I do not get it.

            When you vomit me, nasty and undelightful, I can tell that 
            you probably also don’t enjoy doing it, since you are vomiting 
            all the time. Like a sick dog. I also find that there are 
            many repairs to be done, when you peck me out of my home, it 
            is not the ineffable homecoming experience that I hope for, 
            which makes for a sizable melancholy day. Joylessly, your
            babies are ruthless, and they just tear me apart. 
            Coming home to see my house a disaster, I find it to be a 
            terrible day, and that is one of the worst things about 
            this whole process. Throughout my years of being a worm,
            I find that this kind of thing ruins family connections.
            Worms live a rough life.
